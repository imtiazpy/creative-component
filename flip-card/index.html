                        One way to deal with the fear of the future is to try to educate yourself about what may happen. This can help you feel more prepared and in control. Another way is to focus on the present moment and try to live in the here and now. This can help you feel more grounded and less anxious about what may or may not happen in the future. You can also try talking to friends or a therapist about your fears, as this can help you process and cope with your feelings. Finally, try to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, which can help you feel more calm and centered.
